# Minutes
Solar Car meeting minutes generator  
District decided clubs need meeting minutes, which is not my favorite, so I'm making a generator for them  
Written in bash. Designed to be easy to modify if another club wants to use it  
Everything's written in bash, and should be cross-compatible, but using the setup arg requires Arch or some Arch-based distro
